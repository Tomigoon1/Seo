                <p class="article center">
                    When wine spills, it is crucial to act as soon as possible to prevent the stain from setting into the fabric fibers, which would make it harder to remove.

                <h2 class="center">Additional Tip: Use Baking Soda</h2>
                <p class="article center">
                    If the stain is still visible, sprinkle baking soda over the damp area and let it sit for 30 minutes. This will help absorb the remaining wine. Then, wash the garment as usual.

                <h2 class="center">Additional Tip: Use Club Soda</h2>
                <p class="article center">
                    Club soda is an excellent option for treating fresh wine stains. Pour club soda directly onto the stain, and the bubbles will help lift the wine from the fabric. Then blot with a clean cloth and repeat if necessary before washing the garment.
